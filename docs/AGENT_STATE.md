## Current phase
**Phase 2 — Project Ingestion** (Phases 0 and 1 complete).

## Current milestone
Implement project ingestion: `devos scan <path>` (walk + ignore rules + classify +
persist file inventory) and `devos projects` (list registered projects).

## Next immediate step
Start Phase 2: add a `modules/ingest` service that walks a target folder applying
ignore rules (.gitignore, node_modules, venvs, binaries, size caps), classifies files
into buckets (frontend/backend/db/api/auth/test/config/other), and upserts `projects`
+ `files` rows idempotently. Wire up `devos scan` and `devos projects`. TDD: write
ingest tests first.

## Tasks
### In progress
- _None (Phase 1 just completed; Phase 2 not yet started)._

### Completed
- [x] Phase 0: vision confirmed; 4 foundational decisions made (see DECISIONS.md).
- [x] Created/populated mandatory docs: PROJECT_BRIEF, ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE, AGENT_STATE,
      TODO, PROGRESS_LOG, DECISIONS, CHANGELOG, KNOWN_ISSUES.
- [x] Phase 1: scaffolded `devos` package (cli, config, storage+schema, providers/ai mock,
      commands, core/workspace, module stubs); `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`.
- [x] Phase 1: `pip install -e .` works; `devos --version|init|status` verified end-to-end;
      10 smoke tests pass (`python -m unittest`); first git commit made.

### Blocked
- _None._

## Known assumptions
- Single power user; multi-user is a future extension.
- Foundation runtime is stdlib-only (no external pip deps required to run).
- AI is mocked until a real Claude provider is wired in (no API key needed yet).
- Windows is the primary dev OS (paths handled cross-platform via `pathlib`).

## Open decisions
- CLI framework: stdlib `argparse` now; revisit Typer/Rich in Phase 7. _(Default chosen.)_
- Embeddings/semantic search backend: deferred to Phase 3+. _(Open.)_

## Working context
- Repo: `C:\Projects\DeveloperOS` · git branch: `main` · platform: Windows 11 · Python 3.13.5.
- No remote configured yet.
- Run app: `pip install -e .` then `devos <command>`. Tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests`.
- Isolate the data dir in dev/tests via the `DEVOS_HOME` env var.

## How to continue (session startup)
1. Read this file. 2. Read ROADMAP.md. 3. Read TODO.md. 4. Read latest PROGRESS_LOG.md entry.
5. Read DECISIONS.md / KNOWN_ISSUES.md if relevant. 6. Resume from "Next immediate step".
